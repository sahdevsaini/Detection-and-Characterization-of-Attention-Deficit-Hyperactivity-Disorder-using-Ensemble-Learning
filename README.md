# Detection-and-Characterization-of-Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder-using-Ensemble-Learning
ADHD dataset was considred for this assignment. This dataset consists of two classes ADHD and Control where ADHD means the person is affected with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and control means the person is normal. The labels were also added to these vectors were:- 1 -> ADHD class 0 -> Control class Finally the dataset was tested against various machine learning models.For each model the best results are summarised below :-

1.) Bagging Meta Estimatoralgorithm 95%.

2.) Gradient Boosting Algorithm 96%

3.) XGBoost Algorithm 93%
